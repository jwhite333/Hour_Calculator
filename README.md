# Doble Hour Calculator

This repository is a timecard management tool for Doble Co-ops to use alongside Ultipro.
Ultipro is very accurate, and since Co-ops must try to get as close to 40 hours / week as 
possible, it can often be challenging to time punches correctly. This tool assists in 
keeping track of punch times, and (to within 2 seconds) inform Co-ops when they should punch in or out,
as well as help plan a schedule for an entire two week pay period
